# Generators

Generators provide the entry points for code generation. A generator takes an
API expression produced from an API design and generates one or more files. The
process is done in two steps: the `Writers` function exposed by the generator
packages takes the API expression and returns a slice of `FileWriter`. Each
`FileWriter` contains the data required to generate a single output file. The
data includes a slice of `Section`. A `Section` contains a template and the data
required to render it. The goa code generator package iterates through the list
and renders all the templates.

This two step process (first call `Writers` then iterate over the writer
sections and render the templates) makes it possible to modify the templates
prior to the code generator iterating. This provides the basic for writing code
generators that modify the output of existing ones. An example would be a
middleware generator that modifies the controller generator templates to inject
code prior and/or after the action is run.

```go
// Writers accepts the API expression and returns the file writers used to
// generate the output.
func Writers(api *design.ApiExpression) []FileWriter, error

// A FileWriter exposes a set of Sections and the relative path to the output file.
type FileWriter interface {
    Sections()   []*Section
    OutputPath() string
}

// A Section consists of a template and accompaying render data.
type Section struct {
    // Template used to render section text.
    Template text.Template
    // Data used as input of template.
    Data interface{}
}
```

# Generated Files

All generated files that get re-generated each time should be written to the
same top level directory e.g. `gen`.
